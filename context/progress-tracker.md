# Progress Tracker

Update this file whenever the current phase, active feature, or implementation state changes.

## Current Phase
- Feature 02 : TBD

## Current Goal
- Define the immediate implemenatation goal here .

## Completed

- Feature 01: Design System — shadcn/ui installed and configured for Tailwind v4, dark-only theme tokens in globals.css, Button/Card/Dialog/Input/Tabs/Textarea/ScrollArea components added to components/ui/, lucide-react installed, lib/utils.ts cn() helper in place. TypeScript compiles clean.

## In Progress

- None yet .

## Next Up
- Feature 02 : TBD

## Open Questions

- None yet .

## Architecture Decisions

- shadcn/ui over Tailwind v4 (CSS-based token config via @theme inline in globals.css, no tailwind.config.js).
Dark-only theme: all shadcn :root variables set to dark values directly — no .dark class switching.
Do not modify generated components/ui/* files after shadcn installation.

## Session Notes

- Using Next.js 16.2.4 with React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4.
- shadcn version 4.5.0 was used; it auto-detected Tailwind v4.
- lucide-react ^1.11.0 installed as a direct dependency.
